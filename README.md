# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This is one of the toughest assignment I did so far. But its mostly not understanding the flow of code in Javascript, with variables, funtions (different types), arrays and array of arrays!

I still have to work on adding variable to generate function. I have to read up on that. Work on it and than add it at later time. Atleast now I know where I have to put my efforts.

Besides that the app is functional as MVP.

Following are my links to the github repository and the deployed website link.
